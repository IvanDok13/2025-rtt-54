1. Most challenging enhancements – Managing keyboard navigation and dynamic elements was difficult because ensuring correct focus order and compatibility with screen readers required extra testing and fine-tuning.

3. Color contrast tools – Tools like WAVE, Axe, and Contrast Checker identified low-contrast text and backgrounds, helping adjust colors to meet WCAG standards for readability.
